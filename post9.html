            <p>I’m not entirely sure I grasped every twist, but Florence Knapp’s
                book <em>The Names</em> feels like three novels in one. This piece of art thrills and sometimes
                overreaches.</p>
            <p>In a beautyfuly writen prose, Knapp explores how his one choice — naming a
                child — splits the reality into three parallel lives for Cora and her son.
            </p>
            <p>At the begining I found myself doubting whether the tripartite
                structure would hold my attention, yet each part pulls you back and forth with fresh and high emotional
                stakes.
            </p>
            <p>The novel opens in October 1987, as Cora walks through storm debris
                to register her baby’s birth — a scene both sreal, sad and strangely epic.</p>
            <p>As Cora weighs "Bear", "Julian", and "Gordon", you can just sense her fear,
                her hope and her trembling agency — and I’m left feeling if any name really matters.
            </p>
            <p>Every seven years the timelines fork, showing how domestic abuse,
                resilience and love unfold differentl in each reality.
            </p>
            <p>Characters cross over gently entangeling the three worlds together in a way that felt unexpectedly
                tender.
            </p>
            <p>Some critics fault the one-dimensional villainy of Gordon, but I
                wasn’t entirely convinced he was meant to be more than a force of nature — still, it left me unsettled
            </p>
            <p>Goodreads reports an average rating of 4.27/5 from nearly 3,000
                readers, suggesting many share my mixed wonderment and harried admiration .
            </p>
            <p>While it occasionally feels schematic, <em>The Names</em> ultimately
                asks more questions than it answers — and I can’t decide if that’s frustrating or exhilarating
            </p>
            <p>In the end, this is less a book about names and more a meditation on
                choice, chance, and the fragile architecture of identity — a rare debut that lingers
            </p>
