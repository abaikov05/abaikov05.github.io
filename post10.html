            <h1><b>No Tax on Tips</b> : Exempting Tips from Federal Income Tax</h1>
            <p>Imagine that you are a waiter or bartender in one of the cozy American restaurants: 70–80% of your income
                consists of tips that you receive from grateful guests. And suddenly it turns out that you no longer
                have to pay federal income tax on these very tips. Sounds like a small revolution, right? But is
                everything as simple and profitable as it seems at first glance? Let's figure everything out in order.
            </p>

                THINGS TO KNOW: No Tax ..</a>
            <h2>What is the "No Tax on Tips Act"?</h2>
            <p>In May 2025, the US Senate unanimously passed a bill that received the unofficial name "No Tax on Tips
                Act". Its essence is as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Exemption from federal income tax for tips (including cash, cards and checks) up to an amount of
                    $25,000 per year.</li>
                <li>The bill provides that it is the employee who will be able to withhold these funds in full, without
                    deducting taxes.</li>
                <li>After the Senate passes the document, it will go to the House of Representatives for consideration,
                    and then to the President for signature.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The initiator was Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, with the support of a number of Democrats — Senators Jacky
                Rosen (Nevada) and Catherine Cortez Masto (Nevada). This is a rare example of truly bipartisan
                cooperation in the difficult current political environment.</p>

            <h2>Why did the idea of “not taxing tips” arise?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Support for service workers.</strong> According to the National Restaurant Association
                    (NRA), tips make up a significant part of the earnings of more than 2.2 million waiters, bartenders
                    and other service teams. Exempting them from tax is a direct way to increase the "net" income of
                    this group.</li>
                <li><strong>Simplifying tax administration.</strong> Working with small amounts of cash tips causes the
                    IRS (US Internal Revenue Service) a lot of questions and difficulties during audits. The new rules
                    could reduce red tape.</li>
                <li><strong>Universality of the measure.</strong> The law applies to tips of any form — cash, bank
                    cards, checks — and is not tied to a specific sector (it can be not only restaurants, but also
                    hairdressers, taxi drivers, couriers, and others).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Who really benefits?</h2>
            <p>At first glance, the benefit is obvious: “take the tips — and don’t deduct taxes on them.” However, the
                real economic benefit may be less impressive:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Standard deduction.</strong> As of 2025, the standard deduction for a couple was $27,700.
                    This means that if your annual income (including all tips) is below this amount, you don’t pay
                    federal income tax anyway. Thus, a large portion of the poorest service sector workers were not
                    subject to tax liability anyway.</li>
                <li><strong>Amount limit.</strong> The maximum benefit of $25,000 per year may be completely meaningless
                    for those whose total income does not exceed the tax threshold. And for the most “advanced” waiters
                    and bartenders who receive high tips (for example, thanks to generous guests at elite
                    establishments), there remains the risk of abuse mechanisms: it is technically possible to try to
                    classify other payments as “tips” and deduct significant amounts from the tax.</li>
                <li><strong>Does not affect other fees.</strong> The exemption applies only to federal income tax.
                    Federal contributions to Social Security and Medicare (FICA), as well as possible state income
                    taxes, are still withheld from the full amount.</li>
            </ul>
            <a href="https://www.eater.com/24221282/no-taxes-on-tips-act-explained">Congress Is Poised to Pass</a>
            <h2>What do the experts say?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The Center for American Progress notes that the benefit will be significant only for those workers
                    whose annual income is in the middle range, and the vast majority of low-paid workers already use
                    the standard deduction without taxes.</li>
                <li>Vox.com points out that only about a third of employees who receive tips actually pay federal taxes
                    on their main income, and the economic “gain” from the full exemption may be minimal.</li>
                <li>The National Restaurant Association (NRA), on the other hand, welcomes the new law as “an emergency
                    tax relief measure for the more than 2.2 million restaurant workers, especially in the face of
                    inflationary pressures.”</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What are the risks and pitfalls?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Administration of the list of professions.</strong> The law requires the US Secretary of the
                    Treasury to publish within 90 days of its adoption a list of professions for which the exemption
                    applies. This creates uncertainty about who exactly will be included on this list, and it is
                    possible that the required conditions may be too strict.</li>
                <li><strong>Possibility of abuse.</strong> Critics point to loopholes: highly paid specialists (for
                    example, nannies, luxury service drivers, cosmetologists) can register their fees as “tips”,
                    transferring significant amounts into the category of non-taxable.</li>
                <li><strong>Political will and further steps.</strong> Even if the House of Representatives approves the
                    law, it will have to be signed by the president. As the political landscape changes, the final
                    version may undergo significant changes or not go into effect at all.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What’s next?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The House of Representatives.</strong> The next step is for Congress to consider the bill.
                    There is no clear understanding yet when the House will begin voting, but it is expected to happen
                    in the near months.</li>
                <li><strong>The President's signature.</strong> If the bill passes both chambers, its text will be sent
                    to the head of state for signature. Given the political situation, the chances of it being signed
                    seem high, but amendments are possible.</li>
                <li><strong>Practical application.</strong> Once the law is enacted, the IRS and state financial
                    services will begin to develop forms and instructions to take into account the new rules. Workers
                    will have to follow the updates to correctly declare their income.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>The No Tax on Tips Act is an interesting attempt to reduce the tax burden on service workers and simplify
                the administration of tips. However, the real benefit for most waiters and bartenders may be limited:
                many already pay no federal income tax thanks to the standard deduction, and banks and regulators will
                still withhold contributions for Social Security and Medicare.</p>
            <p>However, if you work in the restaurant industry and make a significant portion of your income from tips,
                it's worth keeping an eye on developments: If ultimately adopted, you could keep up to $25,000 in extra
                "net" dollars in your pocket each year — and that's certainly a nice bonus.</p>
