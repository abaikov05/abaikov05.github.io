                <dt> <strong>What is this site about?</strong></dt>
                <dd>This site is just a blog I'm creating for my coursework. Here I post reviews, thoughts, and
                    experiment with things like SEO, JSON-LD, and CSS.</dd>

                <dt> <strong>Why does the site look so simple?</strong></dt>
                <dd>Because it's made for homework and testing out different features. Maybe I'll make it prettier in

                <dd>For now, this is just a test project. But if it becomes interesting or useful, I may continue.</dd>
