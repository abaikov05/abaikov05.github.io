        <dt> <strong>What is this site about?</strong></dt>
        <dd>This site is just a blog I'm creating for my coursework. Here I post reviews, thoughts, and
          experiment with things like SEO, JSON-LD, and CSS.</dd>

        <dt> <strong>Do you really read everything you write?</strong></dt>
        <dd>Yes, I usually only write about things I've read, watched, or studied. Sometimes I test things just
          for practice, like now.</dd>

        <dt> <strong>Why does the site look so simple?</strong></dt>
        <dd>Because it's made for homework and testing out different features. Maybe I'll make it prettier in
          the future - if I have time.</dd>

        <dt> <strong>Can I use your materials?</strong></dt>
        <dd>Sure. If anyone finds my code or text useful, feel free to use it. Please cite the source if you
          copy it in its entirety.</dd>

        <dt> <strong>Will you continue to develop this blog?</strong></dt>
        <dd>For now, this is just a test project. But if it becomes interesting or useful, I may continue.</dd>
