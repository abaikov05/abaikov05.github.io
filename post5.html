                                        Landing!)</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">​Artemis III is set to be NASA's first crewed lunar
                                        landing since
                                        Apollo 17 in 1972. Scheduled for mid-2027, the mission will launch four
                                        astronauts aboard the Orion
                                        spacecraft atop the Space Launch System (SLS) Block 1 rocket from Kennedy Space
                                        Center. After
                                        reaching lunar orbit, two astronauts will transfer to SpaceX's Starship Human
                                        Landing System (HLS)
                                        to descend near the Moon's south pole. ​</span></p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">The landing site is of particular interest due to its
                                        permanently
                                        shadowed craters, which may contain water ice— a vital resource for future lunar
                                        exploration. During
                                        their approximately week-long stay, the astronauts will conduct up to four
                                        spacewalks, collect
                                        geological samples, and test technologies aimed at supporting long-duration
                                        missions. This mission
                                        also plans to deploy a remotely operated rover to assist in exploring the
                                        challenging terrain.

                        <p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Artemis III is not just a return to the Moon; it's a
                                        step toward
                                        establishing a sustainable human presence there and preparing for future

                                        FY 2025 budget, $6.7 billion was earmarked for Artemis, SLS, and Orion, out of a

                                currently heated, as initial plans for the 2026 fiscal year propose a dramatic cut to
                                science funding –
                                almost halving it from $7.5 billion to $3.9 billion. This could push back crucial early
                                robotic missions
                                and delay the Artemis III moon landing by months, or even years. Lawmakers are debating
                                the rising costs
                                of the Space Launch System (SLS) program and the benefits of working with commercial
                                space companies.
                                Meanwhile, NASA stresses that consistent funding is vital for keeping international

                                ensuring the U.S. remains a leader in space exploration. As these budget debates

                                the future of lunar exploration depends as much on political decisions as it does on the
