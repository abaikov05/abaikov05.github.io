                <h1>Golden Dome of America</h1>

                <p><strong>Golden Dome</strong> is a multi-layered defense shield that secures the American home with
                    pinpoint precision, ensuring the integrity and resilience of our nation.</p>
                <p><a href="baikal-github-co-blog.html"><strong>BaikAl Github Co.</strong></a> — if you need a system
                    that is as cool as "Golden Dome" — both in IT and logistics.</p>
                <p><em>Golden Dome for America</em> is a revolutionary concept designed to promote peace through the
                    projection of power and to fulfill President Trump’s vision of deterring adversaries from attacking
                    the United States. This next-generation shield will detect incoming munitions, calculate their
                    trajectory, and launch interceptors to destroy them in flight, protecting the homeland and
                    demonstrating American power.</p>

                    —
                    President Donald Trump about Golden Dome</a>
                <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
                <p>Mobility and innovation to deliver the first <strong>Golden Dome for America</strong> systems by the
                    end of next year. While we deploy proven warfighting foundations, we will deploy the nation’s best
                    minds to rapidly develop breakthrough technologies — like space interceptors and hypersonic defenses
                    — to ensure America’s Golden Dome stays one step ahead of threats.</p>

                <h2>Approach</h2>
                <p>The fastest, most effective path to <strong>Golden Dome for America</strong> is to bring together the
                    best of the defense and commercial industries into a single industrial alliance. It’s a Manhattan
                    Project-scale mission that is both urgent and critical to America’s security.</p>
                <p>Lockheed Martin is committed to partnering with leading companies and emerging technology startups to
                    protect our nation. We lead MDA's national C2BMC team and have already built the world's most
                    powerful missile defense software network, operating 24/7 across the globe. Our integration
                    expertise brings together the best of defense, commercial, and innovative technologies.</p>

                    system</a>
                <h2>Risks</h2>
                <p>When a missile is already over the horizon, it’s not time to beta test. Build on today’s combat
                    experience while advancing tomorrow’s technologies. This mission is too important to leave to
                    chance: effective missile defense requires not only AI and software, but also reliable
                    communications across a global network of sophisticated systems ready to act at a critical moment.

                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>Lockheed Martin has the combat-proven capabilities and integration expertise needed to deliver. Our
                    open architecture approach will leverage the best solutions from commercial, defense, and innovative
                    contractors as they become available, expanding coverage, accelerating timelines, and enhancing
                    deterrence.</p>

                <p>This mission does not tolerate experimentation with unproven technologies — only proven performers
                    can deliver maximum innovation, reliability, and scalability.</p>

                <p>By focusing on mission and partnerships, our innovative solutions will secure the homeland and keep
                    America safe and prosperous.</p>
