            <h1>Golden Dome of America</h1>

            <p><strong>Golden Dome</strong> is a multi-layered defense shield that secures the American home with
                pinpoint precision, ensuring the integrity and resilience of our nation.</p>
            <p><a href="baikal-github-co-blog.html"><strong>BaikAl Github Co.</strong></a> ‚Äî if you need a system
                that is as cool as "Golden Dome" ‚Äî both in IT and logistics.</p>
            <p><em>Golden Dome for America</em> is a revolutionary concept designed to promote peace through the
                projection of power and to fulfill President Trump‚Äôs vision of deterring adversaries from attacking
                the United States. This next-generation shield will detect incoming munitions, calculate their
                trajectory, and launch interceptors to destroy them in flight, protecting the homeland and
                demonstrating American power.</p>

                ‚Äî
                President Donald Trump about Golden Dome</a>
            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>Mobility and innovation to deliver the first <strong>Golden Dome for America</strong> systems by the
                end of next year. While we deploy proven warfighting foundations, we will deploy the nation‚Äôs best
                minds to rapidly develop breakthrough technologies ‚Äî like space interceptors and hypersonic defenses
                ‚Äî to ensure America‚Äôs Golden Dome stays one step ahead of threats.</p>

            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>The fastest, most effective path to <strong>Golden Dome for America</strong> is to bring together the
                best of the defense and commercial industries into a single industrial alliance. It‚Äôs a Manhattan
                Project-scale mission that is both urgent and critical to America‚Äôs security.</p>
            <p>Lockheed Martin is committed to partnering with leading companies and emerging technology startups to
                protect our nation. We lead MDA's national C2BMC team and have already built the world's most
                powerful missile defense software network, operating 24/7 across the globe. Our integration
                expertise brings together the best of defense, commercial, and innovative technologies.</p>

                system</a>
            <h2>Risks</h2>
            <p>When a missile is already over the horizon, it‚Äôs not time to beta test. Build on today‚Äôs combat
                experience while advancing tomorrow‚Äôs technologies. This mission is too important to leave to
                chance: effective missile defense requires not only AI and software, but also reliable
                communications across a global network of sophisticated systems ready to act at a critical moment.
